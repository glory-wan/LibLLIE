## Model Introduction

Zero-DCE formulates low-light enhancement as an image-specific curve estimation problem. The model does not rely on paired low-light/normal-light images for supervised training; instead, it learns pixel-wise enhancement curves through a set of no-reference constraints. Its core characteristics are a lightweight structure, fast inference, and suitability for zero-reference low-light enhancement scenarios.

In LibLLIE, Zero-DCE outputs the enhanced image and curve parameters. In training mode, the model returns `pred` and intermediate variables needed by the loss through the standard output structure; in inference mode, it directly returns the enhanced image.
